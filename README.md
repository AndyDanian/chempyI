# chempyI
This repository is developed with Python 3.10.12 and Linux like O.S. 

Moreover, this reporsitory involves codes and resources about the Chemistry-Python Course I. The different topics are explained through the jupyter notebooks which can open with visual study or on github when you change github.com by github.dev. Also, it is used presentation and make a python program.

## Contents

The Chemistry-Python Course I is composed by four modules and each one involves different topics. 

* Module 0
	* Work Environment: Install Python and VsCode
	* Work Environment: VsCode configurations and virtual environment
* Module 1
	* Definition: Python, data types and binary operations
	* Definition: for and while loops. if-elif-else conditional. Conditional and boolean operators. 
	* Definition: input and output. import. open, read and write files.
	* Program: made structured data from csv file
	* Program: the atomic mass porcentage from molecule formule
	* Program: calculate quantities of ideal gases from its equation

	* Program: Substance oxidized and reduced in redox reaction

* Module 2

* Module 3

* Module 4

# Requeirment 
The first step is to build virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv /path/virtual_environment_name
```
to activate the virtual environment

```
source /path/virtual_environment_name/bin/activate
```
to exit the virtual environment, execute the next command in the prompt

```
deactivate
```
For the correct work, it is necessary to install the next packing:

```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install jupyter
pip install ipykernel
```
or execute

```
pip install -r requeriment.txt
```
