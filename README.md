# chempyI
This repository is developed with Python 3.10.12 and Linux like O.S. 

Moreover, this reporsitory involves codes and resources about the Chemistry-Python Course I. The different topics are explained through the jupyter notebooks which can open with visual study or on github when you change github.com by github.dev. Also, it is used presentation and make a python program.

## Contents

# Requeirment 
The first step is to build virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv /path/virtual_environment_name
```
to activate the virtual environment

```
source /path/virtual_environment_name/bin/activate
```
to exit the virtual environment, execute the next command in the prompt

```
deactivate
```
For the correct work, it is necessary to install the next packing:

```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install jupyter
pip install ipykernel
```
or execute

```
pip install -r requeriment.txt
```
